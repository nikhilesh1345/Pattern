// 424. Longest Repeating Character Replacement
// You are given a string s and an integer k. You can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character. You can perform this operation at most k times.

// Return the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing the above operations.

// Example 1:
// Input: s = "ABAB", k = 2
// Output: 4
// Explanation: Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.

// Example 2:
// Input: s = "AABABBA", k = 1
// Output: 4
// Explanation: Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA".
// The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.

  const characterReplacement = (s, k) => {
    let left = 0;
    let right = 0;
    let maxCharCount = 0;
    const visited = {};
  
    while (right < s.length) {
      const char = s[right];
      visited[char] = visited[char] ? visited[char] + 1 : 1;
  
      if (visited[char] > maxCharCount) maxCharCount = visited[char];
  
      if (right - left + 1 - maxCharCount > k) {
        visited[s[left]]--;
        left++;
      }
  
      right++;
    }
  
    return right - left;
  };
//   Maintain left and right pointer, max instances of a single char, and visit counts for each char.
// for each char in string
// increment visit count for this char
// if new visit count is higher than max, update max
// if length of current string without max char count is greater than k,
// then we know the new char made it such that there are more chars missing than can be replaced by k,
// so we will remove the first char
// and increment left pointer
// increment right pointer to look at next char.
// In the end, the answer is whatever the window size is. This is because we never shrink the window size.
// As we look at new chars, we increase the window size.
// Once we see we can no longer increase due to limitation of k, we slide the window forward.
// In these inbetween states, it's possible the window doesn't span a valid subset,
// but that doesn't matter because the window size at one point did span a valid set.
// Instead, we wait until there's a possibility of a better set, which is when there is a substring with more instances of some char.
